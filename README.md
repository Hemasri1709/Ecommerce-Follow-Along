# Ecommerce-Follow-Along
## Project description
In addition to e-commerce capability, the application embodies characteristics of a vibrant website which has been built with the help of the MERN stack (that includes MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js - apart from React.js). Hence, with this, the web application has all the wonderful features a user may require to have an enjoyable shopping experience while the background is loaded with robustness for the management of products, users and orders. Efforts on scalability security with real life usability have led to the development of this application.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview
Session Summary
This first milestone concentrated on providing background into the e-commerce project, attempting to understand how its architecture operates and the functions that it includes. Central to the session was a thorough discussion of MERN stack's architecture and how to configure it, in addition to preparing the repository for development purposes.
